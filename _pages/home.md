We are a research group in [School of Electronics Engineering](https://see.knu.ac.kr/eng/){:target="_blank"} at [Kyungpook National University](http://en.knu.ac.kr){:target="_blank"}.

Our lab explores artificial intelligence (AI) by drawing inspiration from the brain’s underlying mechanisms. We focus on three main research areas: ***Brain-Inspired AI***, where we develop algorithms modeled after the biological structure, function, and principles of the brain such as spiking neural networks. ***Generative AI***, where we develop advanced deep learning algorithms that emulate neural processes to create novel content or edit images and videos. ***Physical AI***, in which we design intelligent systems that interact with objects and interpret the physical world (see our [Research](research)).

We have a lab [GitHub](https://github.com/KNU-BrainAI){:target="_blank"} page to share our lab stuff including lab website, code, research projects, and etc.
Please visit our lab [GitHub](https://github.com/KNU-BrainAI){:target="_blank"} to get more information.
