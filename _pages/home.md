We are a research group in [School of Electronics Engineering](https://see.knu.ac.kr/eng/){:target="_blank"} at [Kyungpook National University](http://en.knu.ac.kr){:target="_blank"}.

We investigate artificial intelligence (AI) by understanding the underlying mechanisms of the brain. In particular, we develop novel deep learning algorithms that mimic the neurons in the brain and apply state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to analyze diverse empirical data. We are also interested in investigating natural language processing and computer vision that lead the AI research field. (see our [Research](research)).

We have a lab [GitHub](https://github.com/KNU-BrainAI){:target="_blank"} page to share our lab stuff including lab website, code, research projects, and etc.
Please visit our lab [GitHub](https://github.com/KNU-BrainAI){:target="_blank"} to get more information. 

We are grateful for funding from Kyungpook National University (KNU), National Reserach Foundation of Korea (NRF), and Agency for Defense Development.
