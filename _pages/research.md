# Research

We believe that better understanding of the brain plays a vital role in developing intelligent systems. Since rapid progress has been made in the artificial intelligence (AI) field, it is crucial to investigate the importance of the brain to come up with ideas that will accelerate and guide AI research. Thus, we seek to develop novel deep learning algorithms inspired by the brain functions. Our lab is interested in the following research areas but not limited.<br><br>

  The brain provides a rich source of inspiration for new types of algorithms and architectures of artificial intelligence (AI) and can provide validation of AI techniques that already exist. If a known algorithm is subsequently found to be implemented in the brain, then that is strong support for its plausibility as an integral component of an overall general intelligence system. Our view is that leveraging in-sights gained from neuroscience research will expedite progress in AI research. As convolutional neural networks are inspired by the vision system in the brain, understanding brain functions is a key for developing novel deep learning models. We study neuroscience to understand the brain and develop brain-like neural networks based on how the brain works.

  Although deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, current approaches have several major problems: typical vision datasets are labor intensive and costly to create while teaching only a narrow set of visual concepts; standard vision models are good at one task and one task only, and require significant effort to adapt to a new task; and models that perform well on benchmarks have disappointingly poor performance on stress tests, casting doubt on the entire deep learning approach to computer vision. To address these problems, we study a neural network that it is trained on a wide variety of images with a wide variety of natural language supervision thatâ€™s abundantly available on the internet to generate images of high visual qualityfrom text prompts. <br><br><br>

 Physical AI is a transformative field at the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, dedicated to creating intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act within the real world. Unlike traditional AI, which operates solely in digital or virtual environments, Physical AI endows machines with the ability to sense, interpret, and physically interact with their surroundings through advanced sensors, actuators, and adaptive algorithms. <br><br><br>
