# Research

We believe that better understanding of the brain plays a vital role in developing intelligent systems. Since rapid progress has been made in the artificial intelligence (AI) field, it is crucial to investigate the importance of the brain to come up with ideas that will accelerate and guide AI research. Our lab is interested in the following research areas but not limited.<br><br>

- **Brain-Inspired AI** ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/cnn.png){: style="width: 500px; float: right"}
  
  The brain provides a rich source of inspiration for new types of algorithms and architectures of artificial intelligence (AI) and can provide validation of AI techniques that already exist. If a known algorithm is subsequently found to be implemented in the brain, then that is strong support for its plausibility as an integral component of an overall general intelligence system. Our view is that leveraging insights gained from neuroscience research will expedite progress in AI research.

- **Generative AI** ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/DAFT-GAN.png){: style="width: 500px; float: right"} 
  
  Generative AI is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on creating new content—such as text, images, audio, video, or code—by learning patterns from large datasets and then generating data that mimics or extends those patterns. Unlike traditional AI, which typically classifies, predicts, or analyzes existing data, generative AI produces entirely new data or media in response to prompts, often achieving results that closely resemble or even surpass human creativity. <br><br><br>
  
- **Physical AI** ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/RT-2.png){: style="width: 500px; float: right"} 
  
  Physical AI is an emerging and transformative discipline that fuses artificial intelligence with robotics, enabling machines to not only process information but also perceive, reason, and act within the real, physical world. Unlike traditional AI—which is confined to software, digital data, and virtual environments—Physical AI is embodied in hardware systems such as robots, drones, autonomous vehicles, and smart devices that interact directly with their surroundings. <br><br><br>
